Version 2.07b:
--------------

  - A bugfix to fprint_response() will help reduce false positives that
    could occur for differential tests (i.e. the query and shell injection
    tests)

  - We now suppress implicit cache warnings when dealing with 302, 303 and 307
    redirects.

  - Added --no-checks which allows a scan to be run without any injection
    tests. This still allows bruteforcing and combines well with the
    new ability to load URLs from previous scan results.

  - We can now parse the pivots.txt, which can be found in the output
    directory of older scans. All URLs will be loaded which seriously
    speeds up recurring scans.

  - Directory bruteforcing now includes a content negotiation trick where
    a using a fake mime in the Accept: header will cause some servers to
    propose us files via a 406 response.

  - A horrible bug fix which caused instable pages not be marked
    as such. The result: false positives.


Version 2.06b:
--------------

  - Crawler update which gives more control over the injection test
    scheduling. This comes with the --checks and --checks-toggle
    flags to display and enable/disable checks.

  - Pages where the response varies are no longer completely
    discarded. Instead now we only disable tests that require stability
    which increases scan coverage.

  - Split the traversal and disclosure test to increase coverage:
    traversal checks require stable pages, the disclosure checks can be
    performed on all.

  - Updated dictionaries and converted them to use the dictionary
    optimisations we introduced in 2.03b

  - Fixed offline report viewing (thanks to Sebastian Roschke)

  - Added NULL byte file disclosure tests

  - Added JSP inclusion error check to analyse.c

  - Added XSS injection tests for cookies

  - Directory listings are now reported as individual (info-type) issues

  - Added warning in case the negotiated SSL cipher turns out to be a
    weak one (leaving the cipher enumeration to network scanners)

  - Added experimental -v flag which can be used to enable (limited)
    runtime reporting. This output is written to stderr and should be
    redirected to a file, unless you use the -u flag.

  - The man page has been rewritten and now includes detailed descriptions
    and examples.

  - A whole bunch of small bug fixes


Version 2.05b:
--------------

  - Fixed a NULL pointer crash when adding "callback" tests to JavaScript
    URLs that have a parameter with no value.

  - Bug fix in the redirect callback which expected 2 responses but
    since 2.04b actually should process 4.

Version 2.04b:
--------------

  - Support for #ro, -W-; related documentation changes.

  - HTTPS -> HTTP form detection.

  - Added more diverse traversal and file disclosure tests (including file:// scheme tests)

  - Improved injection detection in <script> sections, where a ' or "
    is all we need to inject js code.

  - Added check to see if our injection strings end up server Set-Cookie,
    Set-Cookie2 and Content-Type reponse headers

  - URLs that give us a Javascript response are now tested with a
    "callback=" parameter to find JSONP issues.

  - Fixed "response varies" bug in 404 detection where a stable page would be marked unstable.

  - Bugfix to es / eg handling in dictionaries.
